# Non Object Notation (NON) Programming Language

> A programming language that imitates the way we think using _frames_ to represent knowledge

The initial aim of the language is to reduce the overhead of using a mind-map. The tokens that should map naturally to your brain are:
* frames,
* slots,
* defaults,
* aliases, and
* terminals.

You can make business motivation digital and consistent fast with _non_, and discuss implementation details with dev later.

Frame

A simple mind-map, using frames:

Capitalise the first letter of each word in a “Frames”

Slot and default
----------------
Each of these stakeholders should have “Slots” that can distinguish one record from another.
Let's do “Person” as an example:
```
Person
    home language: English
    nationality: American
    first name: John
    birthdate: 1986-10-11
    gender: Male
      Male
      Female
    surname: Doe
    title: Mnr
      Mnr
      Miss
      Mrs
      Ms
      Dr
      Prof
    social security number
    initials: J
    is living: Yes
    marital status: Married
      Married
      Divorced
      Single
      Widow
      Widower
    occupation status: Employed
      Employed
        Contributor
        Manager
        Executive
        Non Executive
        Independent
      Self Employed
      Unemployed
      Retired
    residential status: Renting
      Renting
      Home Owner
    education standard classification: Masters
      Childhood
      Primary
      Lower Secondary
      Upper Secondary
      Postsecondary Non Tertiary
      Short Cycle Tertiary
      Bachelors
      Masters
      Doctors
    minor child count
```
A colon separates the slot from it's default. The default is the most likely value a slot can take. Each slot may also act as a selector between frames.
> Order the slots from most to least essential to help readers understand the frame

Terminal
--------

You sometimes have records that you want to present as examples.

Let's use person for this example...
```
Person
   - John Doe
      home language: Afrikaans
      nationality: South Africa
      first name: John
      birthdate: 1986-10-11
      gender: Male
 ```
 The terminal name becomes a “reserved word” and can be used as reference.
> You can do your task list as terminals

 Alias
 -----
 It doesn't have to be all the slots of a frame to be useful. You can also repeat slots if required. For example...
 ```
 Person
     - John Doe
        home language (language): Afrikaans
        business language (language): English
```
Now you have two slots of the same kind, but with two different defaults.

A slot can map to a frame and a default can map to a terminal.

Okay, enjoy. Other features not in the readme:

* how to setup a text editor to make writing and reading more enjoyable,
* _non_ idioms,
* the simple language engine (non.py) to lex and parse the language: you can provide a datastore to dev to use when implementing.

> An interesting use of *non* is to translate to and from Excel for version control.

Cheers!
